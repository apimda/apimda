# Installation

Apimda has separate packages for development, deployment, and runtime.

Assuming you have a single project containing all of your API and deployment code, install the packages for the lambda
runtime, development tools, and CDK deployment:

```bash
npm i @apimda/runtime-lambda
npm i -D @apimda/devtime
npm i -D @apimda/deploy-cdk
```
